# Mobile preview

**Making responsive web design easier**

Simple tool to test websites made using Responsive Web Design
techniques for displaying the same content but with a different visual
presentation in different devices. This technique is mainly used for
mobile devices such as smartphones and tables, but it could also be
used for different things.

This tool it is not a mobile device replacement, it will only help you
when you start working with your responsive web design, but dully
notice that you will always have and should test the final result with
the real device. We are not responsible nor to blame if you don't work
with the right tools.
